# **Structura** Rust GUI Framework

**Structura** is a Rust GUI framework created to learn how to create a GUI framework in Rust. Maybe one day it will be "OK enough" to actually use for something, but you really should not use this.

The **Structura** GUI framework is based on cross-platform components, but has only been tested on Linux under Wayland.

## Repository

The **Structura** repository consists of:

- `structura`: The **Structura** GUI library, including all necessary components an dependencies.
- `structura-app`: A basic app to test and demonstrate the `structura-lib` components.

The [Structura GUI library README](https://github.com/NathanLaan/structura/tree/main/structura) contains an overview of the **Structura** framework, architecture, components, and dependencies.
